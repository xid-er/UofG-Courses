    "The agents started off just hiding the characters as plain binary-encoded ASCII in the knitting patterns. But after some time, they realised that this might be spotted, and applied some *encryption* to the characters. There are 141 characters of unencrypted text at the start of these sequence of messages, as you can verify. After that, the output is jumbled.\n",
    "\n",

The substitution is fixed for the whole series of messages. It is the **key** used to decrypt the messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine the cipher which translates:\n",

    "Every occurence of A becomes Q, every B becomes O, every C becomes F, and so on.  To decrypt and recover the original message, just apply this operation in reverse: every Q becomes an A, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't know what the translation table -- the key -- is being used by the enemy agents in this case. We need to apply simple cryptanalysis to figure out the cipher key and recover the text. **You will have to break this code \"for real\"**\n",

Use this information to find a match with the known unencrypted letter frequencies given above (e.g. if Z is the most common letter in the encrypted text, then it must be a replacement for X, if L is the second most common, it must be the replacement for T, and so on.). **Note: this will require some thinking on your part. Write code to do this -- do not solve this part by hand!**\n",

    "Write a program that takes two airports as input from the user and prints out the *cheapest route*  to get between them. This could include any number of intermediate airports.  The output should include each intermediate airport and the price of each leg of the journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example there is no route at all between LSI and LAX, but you can go LSI->GLA->LHR->LAX. There may be cheaper routes that get you there for less money.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Get this working for the UK airports first. Test it for a few airport pairs and verify you are finding valid routes.\n",
    "1. Then, extend it to the whole world.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How?\n",
    "This is a **shortest path** question. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can consider the problem as a **graph**, in the sense of a set of vertices connected together by edges. This is a very powerful way of representing many problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs/dijkstra_animation.gif\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In formal notation, if we consider a graph $G=(V,E)$ to consist of vertices $V=(v_1, v_2, \\dots)$ and edges $E=(e_1, e_2, \\dots)$, where each edge $e_i$ has an associated **weight** $w_i$ and connects to vertices $(v_j, v_k)$, we want to be able to find a route between a vertex $v_a$ and another vertex $v_b$ that minimises the sum of the edge weights we need to traverse to get there. The total weight of a path through the graph from $v_a$ to $v_b$ is given by by the sum of the edge weights in between $\\sum_i w_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Airports as graphs\n",
    "In our example, the *vertices* of the graph are the *airports*; the *edges* are the *routes*; and the *weights* are the *prices* of the flights between each airport. A path from one airport to another is a path on the graph, and its total cost is the sum of the prices of each leg of the route.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dijkstra\n",
    "[Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) lets us *efficiently* compute shortest paths in any general graph. To solve this problem, you will need to implement Dijkstra's algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Look this up on the Web; the Wikipedia page is a good introduction, but there are many other tutorials you can follow. Start with the simplest version of Dijkstra's algorithm and work from there; the first algorithm given in the \"Pseudocode\" section of the Wikipedia page is relatively easy to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computation time\n",
    "Note: this search will take a second or two to run on the full world data. It should be pretty instantaneous for the UK only data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "Your output for a route like LTN->LGW should look like this:\n",
