    "### B.1: Stopping and stemming\n",
    "Search engines like Google often need to \"clean up\" search queries (the query is the thing you type into a search box) before trying to find terms (words) in documents. The same idea applies to online shopping. Queries might come in like \"I want celery please\". This should be trimmed down to just \"celery\" to do the searching against products.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example `\"what is the fastest python list iterator\"` might be transformed into keywords `[\"python\", \"list\", \"fast\", \"iterator\"]`. In our shopping example, we'd like users who think the computer is a person and type in things like `find me the apples` to be transformed to `[\"apple\"]`, removing the extraneous parts of the search query.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two parts to this: \n",
    "* **stopword** removal, which removes short, uninformative words like \"the\" and \"and\"; \n",
    "* and **stemming** which removes common endings like \"ing\" and \"s\" to find the basic form of a word. Here we'll \"stem\" by just chopping off any bits of words that match common endings.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, you need to write a bit of code to first remove **stopwords** and then **stem** the remaining words. Try getting the stopword removal working first, then go on to the stemming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1. Create your *own list* of common stop words (e.g. [\"and\", \"to\", \"the\", ...]). Stuck? You can use some or all of [this list](https://www.ranks.nl/stopwords)\n",
    "2. Create your *own list* of common English endings (e.g. [\"ing\", \"ings\", \"s\", \"er\", \"tion\"]). Can't think of any? [this list](https://www.thoughtco.com/common-suffixes-in-english-1692725) has some you could include (they might not all be suitable).\n",
    "3. Get user input with `input()`.\n",
    "4. Split the input into words. You can use `my_string.split()` to split a string `my_list` up into a list of individual words, splitting by spaces. (see the example below)\n",
    "5. Remove all of the words in the stopwords from the user input.\n",
    "6. For each word, test if the word ends in one of the common endings, and if it does, remove the ending.  (see the example below on how to use `.endswith()`)\n",
    "7. Print out the cleaned up search terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you can use `.endswith()` on a string to test if the string ends with those characters. You can join a list of strings back together using `join()`, but the syntax is slightly unexpected: see below for how to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note that the rules to make stemming really work well for English are annoyingly complicated. Don't worry if your simple stemmer doesn't do a very sensible job (e.g. \"Sting\" becomes \"St\"!)**\n",

It should simply choose random elements from the input `l` and stuff them into a new list until the new list is the same size as the old list. The length of the random list should be the same length as the original list `l`. **Note that this is not a shuffle, because elements could appear multiple times in the new random list**. You can use `random.choice(l)` to select a random element from a list `l`. \n",
    "3. Write a function `bootstrap(l, n)` which calls `random_draws()` on the list `l` and then computes the mean of the random list. It should do this `n` times and stores the results of the mean calculations in a list of length `n`. There should therefore be `n` mean calculations involved.\n",
