    "# CS1F: Assessed exercise (Part 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise is worth 8% of your mark in total for CS1F.\n",
    "It should be completed individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise has four stages, in consecutive CS1F lab sessions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Designing a conceptual model of an interface.\n",
    "2. Implementing a state machine.\n",
    "3. Linking states to continuous control signals.\n",
    "4. Experimental analysis of usability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You will require your results from previous weeks in each successive exercise!**\n",
    "\n",
    "## A finite state machine\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs/flashlight_design.png\" width=\"60%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will have to implement, refine and adapt your initial designs from last week. \n",
    "\n",
    "This involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Implement the state machine in Python.\n",
    "* Test it, using a UI to simulate transitions.\n",
    "* Adapt it as you see fit to make it work better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in this lab you will be testing only the state machine itself. In the following lab, you will look at how to interpret the motions from the touch slider, transforming continuous inputs into discrete state transitions. The purpose of this exercise is to explore how to analyse how an interface works *without* the specific details of how it is implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the code will be provided as a skeleton, but you will need to define the state machine functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1: design\n",
    "\n",
    "* Review your state machine design and update your diagrams to reflect changes to your design from last week that you want to make.\n",
    "* **Draw the final, complete state diagram for your flashlight**. This should include all states and transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2: implement\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementing the state machine\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a simple structure to define state machines. A state machine is represented by a Python **dictionary**, which maps pairs of `(state, action) -> new_state`. States and actions are just strings. For example, the Finite State Machine drawn below would be represented as this dictionary:"
