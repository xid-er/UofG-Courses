    "# CS1F: Assessed exercise (Part 3)\n",

    "It should be completed in your assigned group.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise has four stages, in consecutive CS1F lab sessions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Designing a conceptual model of an interface.\n",
    "2. Implementing a state machine.\n",
    "3. Linking states to continuous control signals.\n",
    "4. Experimental analysis of usability.\n",

    "In this lab, you will have to take the state machine you built in the previous lab, and interface it to a (simulated) touch slider.\n",
    "You will trigger transitions in the state machine by simulated slide motions, rather than pressing buttons in a GUI. This will connect *continuous valued, continuous time signals* (touch slider movements) to *discrete states* (your Finite State Machine) to build a complete, working interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase space\n",
    "You will design the controls by mapping regions in **phase space** to actions. This just means that movements can be combinations of positions (finger near end or finger near middle, etc.) and velocities (fast leftward swipe or slow rightward swipe).\n",

This smoothing can also simulate effects like having cold fingers, and consequently moving more slowly when operating the controls. In the next lab, you will have to evaluate how your design will work with different levels of noise, and how you will configure smoothing to work well."
