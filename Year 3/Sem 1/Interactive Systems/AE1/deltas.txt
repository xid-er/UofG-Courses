I had to motivate my team to start anything for every single part of the AE. I planned and made the graph for part 1, made pages and interaction between all pages in Figma for part 2, was involved in every part of the planning in part 3 and collated all results and wrote conclusions in part 4.

Robbie contributed sometimes for some parts, but he was nowhere to be seen sometime between part 2 and 3.

Evie was not present much for part 1 and 2, but came through by contributing for the later parts.

Ben was very much on top of everything. He was available for every call and contributed the most to part 4.

Tariq helped a lot in part 2 and a bit in part 1, but he was absent for most of part 3, not being able to accomplish what he promised the team to do.
