This leads to compact, elegant code that can be astonishingly efficient.\n",

    "The practice of writing code which acts on arrays of values simultaneously is called **vectorised computation**. It is a special case of **parallel** computing, where we restrict ourselves to numerical operations on fixed size arrays. Modern CPUs have numerous **vectorised** instructions to perform the same operation on many numbers at once (e.g. MMX, SSE, SSE2, SSE3 on x86, NEON on ARM, etc.). This is called **Single Instruction Multiple Data**.\n",

Anything that can be written as an operation on numerical arrays can be done at lightning speed on a GPU. \n",
