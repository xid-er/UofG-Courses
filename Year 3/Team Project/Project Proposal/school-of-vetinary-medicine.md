# The Flock Information Centre

## App development for The Flock Information Centre, with capacity for expansion in topics, resources provided and language options

Kim Hamer, School of Vetinary Medicine

Transformation of the resource contained here https://quiannenl.wixsite.com/website/home into a downloadable app that can be used offline in low signal and low resource scenarios.  With interactive elements that indicate the interconnected nature of the disease factors. The intention is also to establish a framework which can be expanded to cover other topics, species and have versions in multiple languages.  This is an important resource to support vets and farmers in reduction of on farm losses that impact animal and farmer welfare, farm viability and the environment.
